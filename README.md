 Excel based seasonal forecasting model for bakery SKUs, achieving 94% accuracy and improving efficiency over existing methods.

This project involved a live analysis for a retail company facing challenges in forecasting bakery products, especially their top-selling item, chocolate chip cookies, which resulted in significant losses due to inaccurate predictions. The raw data was extracted from SAP, then cleaned and analyzed to create an Excel-based forecasting model incorporating seasonality adjustments, achieving an impressive 94% accuracy on par with company's existing Blue Yonder forecasts. 

Additionally, this solution streamlined the process by enabling forecasting for multiple SKUs within a single sheet, replacing the prior approach of forecasting individual SKUs separately. This approach not only enhanced efficiency but also significantly improved the predictive accuracy for bakery product forecasts.
